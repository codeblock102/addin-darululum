/**
 * @file src/config/navigation.ts
 * @summary This file defines the navigation structures for different user roles in the application.
 *
 * It exports arrays of `NavItem` objects, which are used to build the sidebar navigation menus.
 * Each `NavItem` typically includes a path (`href`), a display label, an icon, a description, and an optional `exact` flag for route matching.
 * - `adminNavItems`: Defines the navigation links available to users with an admin role.
 * - `teacherNavItems`: Defines the navigation links available to users with a teacher role.
 *
 * Icons are imported from the `lucide-react` library.
